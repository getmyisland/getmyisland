# Hey!

I'm Maximilian Fischer aka GetMyIsland, a 17-year-old apprentice programmer living in Germany, and I love tinkering with computers. I'm currently developing applications with Java and in my spare time I learn more about cybersecurity and ethical hacking. My goal is to become a penetration tester.
