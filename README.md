### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Maximilian Fischer, I'm a 17 year old hobby programmer. I'm mainly making games with Unity, but I also have experience in developing websites with Javascript, HTML and CSS as well as developing small applications with Java or C++.

You can find my own website, which I created, at [getmyisland.com](https://www.getmyisland.com/).

I'm currently focusing on developing a new game, which will get announced sometime in the future [SCP Observer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1738710/SCP_Observer/), my first still unreleased game, is a mix of two of my favorite games and I will release it soon for free on Steam. 

If you like my content you can subscribe to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfdRmRv5aAECBAeawrv5OJg) where I upload videos about my games from time to time or visit my [Itch.io page](https://getmyisland.itch.io/) to see my currently existing games.
